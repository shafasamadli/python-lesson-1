#The first lesson
# "hello" is in string and should be written inside of double quotes and string is data type
# in python double quote and single quote '' have no difference, they are same things
print("hello")
print('salam')
# print is a function to show something in console

# numbers
print(123) # it is integer number
print(23.5) ## it is float number 
print("123") ## it is string not number
#boolean type and it is logic type
# True - positive meaning, False- negative meaning
# note: , comma  : colon  ""  double quotes  '' single quotes
# )-bracket, {}- curly bracket,[]-square bracket

# 'Sharafat' is string and it is value

# Important points to write names of variables:
# 1) beginning with number is not possible like 1num- false
# 2) you cannot write like num-1
# 3)don't use space like num one
# 4)you cannot use capitalized letters when naming of varibles
